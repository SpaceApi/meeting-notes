     * What defines a breaking change



## Website refactoring

See https://content-refactor.spaceapi.io/
PR: https://github.com/SpaceApi/website/pull/66

Feedback so far:
 * Docs not found
 * API docs are harder to find than before

It's hard to find out if people who heard about it the first time understand what the project is about.

Let's merge it as soon as possible and iterate afterwards.

@rnestler got the feedback that a "news" section or activity log is missing. So the project seems dead for some.
It would be nice to have something blog-like where we note stuff like:
 * Meetings with link to protocol
 * Wrap-up on Directory changes (3 new space added in the last month)
 * Anouncment of events (Geekend for example)
 * Sum up work on new schema version
 * Link to GitHub already provides some activity log

## 0.14 release

What hinders us to do the release?

 * Add a document on upgrading and being compatible with both versions.
 * Cleanup the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
 * Update App to be compatible with pure 0.14


## Core vs. Community

Where do which projects belong? We will discuss it in a later meeting.


## Varia

### SpaceAPI Validator bot

Seems broken?

### Decentralized Directory?

Should we decentralize the directory? One simple idea would be to just add a possibility to link to other SpaceAPI endpoints.
So one could discover all endpoints by recursivly following the links.

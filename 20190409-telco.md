## ~~3. Moving the directory~~

## 4. SLA / SLO / SLI

 * We will try our best and communicate exactly this, best effort and no ha

## 5. Website Design

 * [design is done](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/6GQBNILYDSA#/screens/347620975)
 * Implementation
     * Lektor? https://www.getlektor.com/
         * Supports models
         * Not only for blogs
         * Danilo will set up a draft page
     * Simple JS
         * Try to avoid JS libraries, frameworks, etc
         * Site should work without JS enabled
         * On the other hand we can assume a modern browser with ES2015+

## 6. Server / Provisioning

 * Website stats
 * Terraform
     * Add signatures / docs for `deployment/bin/terraform-inventory`
 * OS
     * Alpine would be nice, but Hetzner doesn't provide an image
     * Let's stick with Debian 9 for now
 * Auto security updates
     * Should we update auto reboots on security updates?
         * Yes
 * DNSSEC?
     * Timm will have a look
 * Monitoring
     * We should have an external ping check that notifies us if the server is down
     * All other monitoring can be done on the same server through Grafana

## 7. Geekend?

 * Am Erfa-Treffen?
 * An der Cosin?
 * Am Camp?
 * In einer Bergh√ºtte?

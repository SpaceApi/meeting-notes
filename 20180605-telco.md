## 3. Logo

 * Timm did ask [blinry](https://twitter.com/blinry)
 * He will make multiple drafts
 * No expected time when he will be finished so far

## 4. Hackerspaces.org

 * Meeting at GPN with
   * sva (will be present at Cosin!)
   * hauro
   * mwfc
 * hackerspaces.org would like to use the SpaceAPI to keep an up to date list about hackerspaces
 * They would like to push the SpaceAPI forward because of that
 * Prepare presentation (slides) which introduces the SpaceAPI

## 5. Website

 * Website is online again at http://spaceapi.net/
   * Repo: https://github.com/SpaceApi/temp-new-website/
 * Pull requests & deployment
   * https://github.com/SpaceApi/temp-new-website/pulls
     * Slopjong didn't react at all -> Currently moving to a different city
     * We need a process to update and deploy the website even if some people aren't reachable.
 * Should we move the website to the CCC infrastructure?
   * Set up a docker container to host the website
   * Make it possible that everyone can deploy changes
   * Maybe build the docker image for the website on push?
     * Build the Docker images in CircleCI and push them to hub.docker.org
     * Trigger a pull + restart on the server somehow

## 6. Official Announcement

 * There was confusion in IRC on what the status of the project is
 * Prepare announcement on hackmd
   * New bigger Team
   * Infrastructure provided by CCC
   * We have a CoC
   * Future development of the specs / schema
   * How to participate

## 7. Directory

 * Draft for a new directory service: https://github.com/gidsi/spaceapi-directory
     * Takes directory from fixme/github and modifies it
         * Remove unreachable endpoints
         * Remove endpoints that serve invalid JSON
         * Should return only valid spaces
 * Specifications for directory are discussed in PR: https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/29
 * Should we deploy the directory server to directory.spaceapi.net?
   * Move all non-standard endpoints to /drafts/? YES!
 * Specify both the static input file with the list of spaces and the format which gets delivered by the directory.
   * Suggestion: Input format is a simple CSV with name (used as a "comment") and the URL (multiple version endpoints are multiple rows)
   * The directory parses this and keeps an in-memory version of the full and validated data
   * Endpoint-API vs. Directory-API vs. Directory-Database
     * Subdirectories in the specification repo:
       * endpoints
       * directory-api
       * directory-registry
     * Add a good README explaining the difference between those parts

## 8. Other

 * Move away from GitHub because Microsoft bought it?
   * No pressing need, since our content is public
   * May be a representative issue
   * GitHub was already a propretary service before
   * We would definitely move away if something would happen like issue exports being closed down

 * The wording on spacedirectory.org is not up to date:
   > This fork aims to revive the development activity around the Space API. But we're always ready to discuss joining our forces back with the original project!

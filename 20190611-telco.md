        * https://github.com/SpaceApi/website/pull/33

          * https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/issues/255

Timm
* [ ] ~~Add signature for terraform-inventory~~
* [ ] DNSSEC
    * Waiting for provider to add DNSSEC support to the contorl panel
* [x] Security updates reboot
* [x] Ping check (monitoring)

Raphi
* [ ] Write an initial "Getting Started" guide
    * PR: https://github.com/SpaceApi/website/pull/30
* [ ] ~~Think about menu / navigation on website~~
    * Postponed until new website
    * Will come up again

## 3. Website Design

* Deploy as soon as a MVP is ready, don't wait until the design is finalized and fancy
* Next steps:
    * Danilo: Review and merge https://github.com/SpaceApi/website/pull/33
    * Work on content (can be independent from design)
    * Work on implementing the design

## 4. Validator

Currently we are limited because parts of the validator are implemented client side in Javascript. We should add a way to validate on server-side. See https://github.com/SpaceApi/validator/issues/32.

 * Should we enforce https?
 * Should we require CORS headers?
     * This would break hosting on GitHub/GitLab pages.
         * This may be a positive thing, because it avoids dead endpoints where the hackerspace doesn't exit anymore, but the static JSON file is still there.

## 5. Moving the Directory

Done. https://github.com/spaceapi/directory. All glory to the team!

## 6. Geekend? SpaceAPI-Hackathon?

Camp! Not really suited for getting a lot of work done though since we will have other stuff to do. But we can do a SpaceAPI Meetup at Camp.

Timm will probably visit Raphi and Danilo in Switzerland sometime.

Should we make the event public or would that increase organization overhead?

Thing we will need to prepare:
 * [ ] Agenda. So that we can work productively
 * [ ] Location (Coredump?)
 * [ ] Date
 * [ ] Food
 * [ ] Announce on chat, ML and Twitter.

## 7. Sticker

Some stickers are on their way to Switzerland, should be available at CoSin.

There's high demand for those stickers!

## 8. Doing Stuff Policy

Instead of always requiring code reviews, we should probably only request / require code reviews if it makes sense.

For example, a version bump of a dependency or a README typo fix does not require a review and can be merged directly.

Changes should still be done through PRs though, so that others can see what changed.

## 9. Space Radar

https://github.com/spaceapi-community/SpaceRadar

The app needs a server for push notifications. Currently maintained by Timm. To avoid single point of failure we should probably share the credentials.

New repository in SpaceApi-community (SpaceRadar-provisioning or similar).

## 10. Metrics broken

The current metric data are not to be trusted. Some issue with the Prometheus InfluxDB connection.

## 11. default basic auth -> oauth community

Currently the credentials are hard coded and authenticated using basic auth. If we switch to OAuth we could use the GitHub credentials and allow everybody from SpaceAPI-Community to access Grafana for example.

## 12. Varia

- Chaostreff Zurich has longitude and latitude mixed up :wink:
    - Danilo wrote an e-mail to the issue report e-mail letting them know about the error.
- We have now 145 working SpaceAPI endpoints :smiley:


## 13. Next Meeting

Chaos Communication Camp :rocket:

## 3. Chat System

Is it worth maintaining an entire Mattermost instance for our project? We're not really using a lot of those features.

What about using a Matrix room instead?

We could experiment with Matrix and then decide.

Changing "behind the back" of the existing users which use our mattermost would be bad. Discuss it openly.

Maybe we could set up a test channel and bridge it to Mattermost/IRC.

## 4. Geekend

### Date

27.3.-29.3. Doesn't work for @Raphi and @Timm anymore. -> Let's Move it to the mid of the year.

 * 8-10. Mai? Seems to work for everybody.

### Location

- Basel would be better to travel from Germany. But we would need a sleeping location there.


## 5. 0.14 Release

What hinders us to do the release?

 * Add a document on upgrading and being compatible with both versions.
 * Cleanup the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
 * Update MyHackerspace App to be compatible with pure 0.14
     * Danilo will try to get it to build with the latest SDKs
     * "Contribution request": https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/issues/67

## Varia

 * We weren't very active on Twitter, notifications were missing.
     * https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/zapier.html maybe?
 * More poeple for the Core Team?
     * Would be nice! g5pw and s3lph were interested last time we asked

     * Make a new one temporarly: space_api
 * spaceapi.net domain
     * We'll use spaceapi.io
     * Redirect spacedirectory.org to spaceapi.io

## 4. Website

 * Use current spacedirectory.org as a basis
     * API documentation
         * Currently done with handmade script
         * Any libraries?
     * Directory
         * Leave it as is on fixme for now (they are doing a great job maintaining it)
     * Validator
       * Move to spaceapi server
       * Pretty print JSON
     * Design
         * Change to responsive design
     * Content
         * Describe the project better
         * Why should I use it?
         * How do I use it?

## 5. Directory spec

 * Since we already have to change the domain anyways, we can also add versioning support immediately
   * E.g. by putting the version in the URL
     * directory.spaceapi.io/v1/

## 6. Archiving the old repositories

 * Create SpaceApi-archive organization
 * We keep
     * provisioning
     * validator
     * meeting-notes
     * temp-new-website (for now)
     * schema

## 7. Directory

https://github.com/gidsi/spaceapi-directory

  * Differentiate between input- and output-formats
    * Input-Format is similar to current JSON, contains no redundant data
      * Maybe just a list of URLs
    * Output-Format may contain dynamically generated data

# SpaceAPIs Workshop at CCC Camp23

## Motivation of the participants

* Get an idea about different implementations and how things were implemented and why
* Further use casse and what could be added to the schema specification
* Some answers how to implement it correctly
* Best practices

## Different implementations like

* Rust server [coredump](https://www.coredump.ch/) ([spaceapi-community](https://github.com/spaceapi-community/spaceapi-server-rs) + [own implementation](https://github.com/coredump-ch/status))
    * Client-Server architecture
    * Door status and other information (sensors) published into Redis with an expiration period -> automatic open/close mechanism
* [Chaos Computer Club Basel](https://ccc-basel.ch/) Implementation 
    * Added additional information like stock of different kind of mate 
    * Door status and other information (sensors) published into InfluxDB
    * Cron Job clears open status
    * [Extra device in space](https://github.com/coredump-ch/nixie-counter)
        * Buttons for people arrive/leave
        * Counter is displayed via Nixie Tubes
* [Fork of the spaceapi-community Rust server by dezentrale](https://github.com/dezentrale/spaceapi-rs)
    * Simple configuration via yaml file to configuration the long living data (address, website, ...)
    * Client-Server architecture
        * The API endpoint runs on a VPS
        * The client runs on an RaspberryPI and send open/close via an additional not specified admin interface protected by an API-Key
    * Next feature Dead man's switch
        * Keep alive every 5 minutes to signal the space is open
        * If client doesn't call after 5 minutes the server set status to closed
        * differentiation between regular open/close request and keep-alive request as business logic
* Python implementation of [Chaostreff Potsdam (CCCP)](https://github.com/orgs/Chaostreff-Potsdam)
    * Python Flask implementation
    * Sensor data from solar power generator is provided
    * Open status is directly gathered by the server application

## Ideas for extensions and other use cases

* There is already an externsion pattern `ext_<fieldname>` to describe data, that's not specified
* Related spaces to express friendship between spaces -> linked spaces already specified for schema specification v15
* Representation of a network of spaces like the ChaosZone (Spaces from East Germany, Czech Republic, ...) -> maybe via an tag
* Solar power generation provided provided by CCCP isn't specified -> CCCP maybe has maybe an open MR as a recommendation for specification

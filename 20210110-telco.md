# 3. Matrix Chat

 * What channels should we bridge? Do we want to keep all those channels, or do we want a single, bridge main channel for public communication?
   * Use a single public channel bridged between Matrix, Mattermost and IRC
   * Make Mattermost non-public
   * For core-team-discussions use the existing Threema group
   * For alerting, keep it on Mattermost for now, but evaluate whether we can move it to Matrix
       * Then we could turn off Mattermost

# 4. MyHackerspace

 * Rorist doesn't currently have much time for maintaining the app
 * He'd transfer it to us
 * Danilo will create a Google developer account for the SpaceAPI organization

# 5. Website Deployment

 * Right now the CircleCI Docker image pushing doesn't work
 * Move to GitHub CI, fix credentials
     * To allow access for a new repository, go to https://github.com/organizations/SpaceApi/settings/secrets/actions/DOCKER_PASSWORD
     * Credentials belong to the `spaceapibot` user, which is in the `publishers` team on Docker Hub

# 6. Validator connection leak

* The validator has a connection leak that needs to be fixed, so far we have to reboot the validator before we hit the limit, otherwise a complete reboot is recommended

# X. Varia

- Watchtower Docker upload rate limiting problem should now be fixed: https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/issues/669
- SpaceAPI Remote Geekend 20.02.2021 (maybe?)

# Next Meeting

* 2021-02-20 Remote Geekend

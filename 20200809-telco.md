# 3. V14 Release

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/issues/65

Blockers:
 * Let's just release v14 without support in the MyHackerspace app
 * Let's remove the spacephone link and fix the other links
 * Postpone https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/71 to v15 (There was a discussion about the use case and value but let's continue this on GitHub)

-> Release the thing!

# 4. Make grafana publicly available

https://metrics.spaceapi.io/

Allow read only access for anonymous users. Potential harm they can do is DOS but the chances are low.
Let's try it and disable it if we encounter problems.


# 5. Linked spaces

Current plan:
 * Have just a simple field in the spec with just the website URL of the linked space
 * If this field is used a lot, try to make the spaceapi discoverable from the website URL (probably via .well_known/)  to enable a federated directory

No activity on the pull request:
https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/75
https://github.com/SpaceApi/directory/issues/144

# 6. Varia

 * Update from cyroxx about the SpaceAPI implementation of his space: 
     * They have a space switch which publishes the open state with MQTT which triggers the SpaceAPI and pushes a chat message.
 * Should we add the ability to get the data of the spaces via api.spacapi.io?
     * Would be nice, since most projects actually want the data of all the spaces
     * But keep the ability to only get the list the default (Useful for other projects)

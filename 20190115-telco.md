## 3. Inclusion of @rorist in the core team

Does @rorist want to join the core team?

@rorist couldn't attend the telco. Let's talk about it next time or via E-Mail / Chat.

## 4. Feedback from 35c3

 * List of language bindings / impementations would be nice: https://github.com/SpaceApi/website/issues/23
 * Entirerly not clear that spaceapi.net is dead and we are the active project
 * I had to explain the fork story multiple time
 * Getting started guide missing: https://github.com/SpaceApi/website/issues/25

## 5. Website

We should do some usability testing. Maybe @timm can find some designer / UX help from CCC people.

It's not clear for people looking at the start page what we are and what we want.

How to describe the SpaceAPI project in one sentence? The My Hackerspace app describes the purpose best currently, when showing it to other people.

Should we add a help needed section?

### Getting Started Guide

https://github.com/SpaceApi/website/pull/30

Should we recoomend static hosting on GitHub / GitLab? The problem is they don't allow setting the CORS header.

**Decision**: We make an example for static hosting on a server (not GitHub/GitLab) which sets the CORS header correctly.


## 6. Directory

### Moving SpaceDirectory

Should we move the SpaceDirectory repository to SpaceAPI GitHub orga?

@rorist must be included in the decision. We'll talk to him about the issue on Mattermost / GitHub.

### Directory Schema

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/29

It's hard to distinguish between the directory source format and the served directory. We need to document this better, maybe even with a diagram :wink: 


## 7. Metrics

https://github.com/SpaceApi/provisioning/pull/35

* https://metrics.spaceapi.io/login 
    * read-only without auth?
* https://prometheus.spaceapi.io/graph
    * basic auth!
    * Currently no auth

Setup:
 * Read and write of data happens via prometheus
 * InfluxDB as storage backend.
 * https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-now-supports-prometheus-remote-read-write-natively/

## 8. TLS on reverseproxy

* https://reverseproxy.spaceapi.io
    * basic auth?

Should this be reachable from the internet? It's easier to setup with traefic that way.

## 9. Ansible-vault from gopass

We will configure Ansible to get the vault password directly from gopass.

The gopass mount shall be named: spaceapi


## 10. Logo on black

@timm pinged blinry to create a logo with a black background.

## 11. Varia

### Promoting SpaceAPI at the CC-Camp
 * Maybe at the CCC-CH assembly?
 * Or at the Chaoswest assembly

### Next Meeting

Tuesday 9th April 18:00UTC / 20:00CEST

### Contact to Slopjong

We made contact to slopjong via SMS. He responded, that he currently doesn't have any time.

### Watchtower

Lots of error / info messegas from the bot. Some get sent on redoploy and the others look like temporary errors.

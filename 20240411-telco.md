## Spec v15

### Description field

- https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/102
- Alternatives to `description`
    * access_hint
    * additional_information
    * how_to_get_in
    * location_hint
    * hint

Example:

```
  "location": {
    "address": "Ulmer Strasse 255, 70327 Stuttgart, Germany",
    "lon": 9.236,
    "lat": 48.777,
    "hint": "Knock three times, say Shibboleet and follow the white rabbit"
  },
```

- Decision: Use `hint`
- Merged into 15-draft.json
 
### Add area key to location

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/71
 
 * It's valueable to have it
 * It's valueable to have multiple areas
 * Maybe it would be valueable to have a type field? Would allow to see if a space has a kitchen for example
   * Sometimes it's hard to specify a type, especially when a room is both a kitchen and a lab (or workshop)
 * Add a simple first version for now, make it extensible

More or less like this:

```
  "areas": [
     {
       type: "kitchen",
       square_meters: 12.5,
       ...
     }
  ]
```

We agree that this should be the way to go. To be done: Bikeshed actual format via GitHub.

### MQTT broker field

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/79

- Not useful without standardizing a clear schema
- All examples mentioned in PR are already part of the current SpaceAPI, so why duplicate them?
- We tend towards rejecting the PR, but will ask for concrete use cases first.

### Decentralize directory (using linked spaces)

https://github.com/SpaceApi/directory/issues/144

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/92/

Two use cases:

 * Bootstrap a directory by crawling and aggregating linked spaces
 * Show a nice list of related spaces on a website or in an app like MyHackerspace

Problem: Once spaces are linked, how are these links updated when they change?

 * It's annoying to update a SpaceAPI endpoint if multiple spaces link to it. One needs to notify all of them.
 * OTOH domains can change too. In many cases over the last few months, domains actually did change.

Problem: Looking up endpoints indirectly through the website adds complexity to clients.

 * Aggregation services can be used to solve this issue
 * On the other hand, some clients like MyHackerspace could currently resolve endpoints, but not other resolution methods like HTML meta tags or .well-known directories.

Why not both:

 * Both an endpoint URL and a website can be specified
 * Discussion: Should one of them be required?
 	* If not, we may fragment the ecosystem a bit, clients that only support one of the methods can only see parts of the "full network".
 	* If we make the endpoint required, then the more flexible lookup methods lose some of their appeal
 	* If we make the website required, then we add required complexity to clients
 	* Not requiring endpoint URLs has the advantage that spaces which don't currently implement SpaceAPI can still be linked

Decision after long discussion:

* Rename `url` to `website`
* Support both `website` and `endpoint`, at least one of them must be provided (with `anyOf` requirement)

### Power generation

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/105

* Remove `mW` type, as it's redundant (there already is `W`)
* Merge!

### Sensors Cleanup

* Check all sensors for redundant units, e.g. mW vs W. Potentially remove them.
* Fix description for `unit` in power consumption, remove references to "flag of a boolean type" and don't suggest that the unit is optional

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/109

### Optional location

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/106

Decision:

* Remove type field, make location optional

### Update CHANGELOG

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

Upcoming v15 changes are missing.

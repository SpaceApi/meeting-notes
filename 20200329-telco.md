Danilo

* [x] MyHackerspace app updates
    * [Upgrade Android SDK, remove MemorizingTrustManager](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/pull/69)
    * [New domain: spaceapi.io](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/pull/65)
    * [Switch default directory to directory.spaceapi.io](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/pull/71)
    * [Use Java 8](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/pull/73)
    * [Update icons with new vector drawables](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/pull/74)
    * [Bump minSdkVersion to 21 (Android 5.0)](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/pull/75)
    * [Add support for annotations](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace/pull/77)

Raphi
 * Tried to implement spaceapi-rs with 0.13 and 0.14 support

# 2. Server TLS Config

The directory can currently not be accessed from Android < 7: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=directory.spaceapi.io

(Funny enough Android 4.2 seems to work, but not Android 5 and 6)

Reason is most probably the ciphersuite selection.

Resources:

- Mozilla recommendations: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS
- Cipherlist: https://cipherlist.eu/

Since the content we serve is not sensitive at all, we don't need to ensure that potentially insecure ciphersuites cannot be chosen by a client that does not support newer ciphers.

# 3. 0.14 Upgrade

 * Provide a example implementation in Python?
 * Generator for Rust: https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/rust 
 * App actively developed again, by @dbrgn and maintained by @rorist :smiley: 
     * Add support for 0.14
 * Open PR
     * Instagram contact -> close because project link is feasible
     * SpaceFED link corrections -> Timm will check with hackerspaces from the Netherlands
 * Open Issues
     * [Schema not reachable](https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/issues/66)
         * Use URN like `urn:spaceapi:schema:root:0.13`?
         * https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/basics.html#declaring-a-unique-identifier uses an URL
         * Let's just host the schema then
     * [New JSON Schema version](https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/issues/59)
         * Vey low support among libraries so far, so let's wait with an implementation until this gets better
     * [3D Printers](https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/issues/57)
         * It's not trivial to create a good spec that covers all cases
         * Maybe some people want to publish information about their CNC mills or their laser cutters?
         * It's probably best to create a draft/proposal and then test it in reality. The `ext_` fields are well suited for this.
     * Streams and feeds: @timm will take a look
     * Maybe add generic URLs? -> @dbrgn
 * Maybe publish a release candidate once all open issues are handled? Then we can get early feedback from implementors, and maybe some implementations can already update their code to support the upcoming release.

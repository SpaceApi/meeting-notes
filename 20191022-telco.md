## 3. Geekend

We kind of used the CCC Camp as Geekend and worked on the website (it's online! :tada:).

Thing we will need to prepare:

* [ ] Agenda. So that we can work productively
* [x] Location
  * Coredump, `(47.23597, 8.84096)`, https://www.coredump.ch/kontakt/
* [ ] Date
* [ ] Food
* [ ] Announce on chat, ML (hackerspaces.org) and Twitter

## 4. HSTS

Should we enable HSTS + Preloading?

https://github.com/SpaceApi/provisioning/pull/59

* Every service would only be available over HTTPS / TLS
* Are there use cases where a limited embedded device needs to access the directory via HTTP?
  * An ATtiny won't be able to run TLS
  * A small ARM will be able to run TLS, but can't do certificate chain verification
  * A niche use case?
* Encrypt everything, because encrypt everything! :lock: 
* If someone has a use case, we can still disable the redirection and wait for the preloading to expire.
  Preloading headers don't apply to embedded devices, only to browsers.

## 5. Validator API

* Add OpenAPI schema (Timm)
* Add error information to output
  * For that, maybe switch to the Go implementation
* Add an endpoint where an URL can be validated directly

## 6. Github Bot

* Work in progress: A bot which checks directory PRs for common problems: https://github.com/SpaceApi/github-bot
* Example: https://github.com/SpaceApi/directory/pull/112 -> https://githubbot.spaceapi.io/pullrequest/112
* TODO: Convert that output into a nice GitHub comment

## 7. Directory View

* Maybe create a nicer directory / space overview?
* Timm is working on something.

## 8. Dockerfile linting

We have a lot of custom Dockerfiles:

* website
* validator
* ...

Running a Docker linter during CI for these would be nice.

## 9. Api field

https://github.com/SpaceApi/schema/pull/56/

Goal is to provide a smooth upgrade path between API versions.
An endpoint could declare compatibility for multiple versions.

Isn't just having multiple endpoints easier?

Why not both approaches? :woman_shrugging:

## 10. Website content

We should improve the website -> https://md.chaospott.de/spaceapi-content

## 11. Next Meetings

Meetup at Chaos Communication Congress

Next Meeting: 2020-01-28 @20:17
